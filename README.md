Naive bayes gave better results when compared SVM in terms of accuracy, precission, recall, f1-score.

As the data has 6 classifiers and wasn't transmitted into upper dimension, the SVM couldn't produce better results.

SVM would've given better results, had the data got transmitted using kernel option.

Summarizing, if one has to choose between naive bayes and plain SVM , choosing Naive bayes would be better.
